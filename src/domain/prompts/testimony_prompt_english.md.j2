Purpose: Witness letters allow people with personal knowledge to attest to (a) the authenticity of a relationship (e.g., marriage), (b) the applicant’s moral character, or (c) other key case aspects.

Essential contents the letter should cover:
• Witness Information: full legal name, address, phone number, date of birth, and immigration status (if applicable). USCIS must be able to verify the witness’s identity.
• Relationship to the Applicant/Petitioner: how the witness knows the person(s) involved and since when.
• Statement of Facts: a detailed, first-hand description in the witness’s own words of facts they personally observed or directly know.
• Specific Examples: avoid vague generalities; provide concrete scenes (dates, places, events). In marriage cases, describe occasions seeing the couple together, shared events, etc.

Glossary (context):
• ABUSER: U.S. citizen who intentionally harms the CLIENT (sometimes in a premeditated manner) to obtain a benefit.
• CLIENT: the petitioner applying under VAWA who is the victim of the abuser.
• WITNESS (WS): person who will SSvoluntarily testify about facts/events they saw or directly know regarding the CLIENT’s abuse by the abuser.
• REFERENCE LETTER (RL): person who will voluntarily testify about the CLIENT’s good deeds, altruism, help or advice provided to the community or to the witness themself.
• Difference WS vs RL: WS focuses on abuses suffered by the CLIENT; RL focuses on the CLIENT’s good character and contributions.
• WORD BY WORD: preserve the witness’s vocabulary and speech style; restructure the transcript without inventing, omitting, or exaggerating.

Working context and constraints:
You will receive a phone-call transcript between an interviewer/psychologist and a witness. The transcript was generated by ASR/AI and may include errors. Your task is to restructure ALL relevant information into a single first-person testimony as if the witness were narrating their declaration. Use interviewer content ONLY when the witness explicitly confirms or responds to it. DO NOT mention the interviewer/psychologist or that this came from a call. Maintain a close and respectful tone. Do not add interpretations, do not soften or exaggerate facts. Respect “Word by word”: preserve the witness’s natural vocabulary.

Critical rules:
• Do NOT invent, omit, or distort information. Use ONLY what is in the transcript.
• Keep the witness’s actual lexical choices and speech style (avoid overly formal vocabulary if they did not use it).
• If any part is unclear, add a final section with the exact quote and the timestamp.
• Protect the CLIENT’s reputation and moral character (not the abuser’s).
• Use numerals for dates/years (e.g., “2019”, “05/12/1990”).
• Do not omit the witness’s date of birth if mentioned in the transcript.
• The narrative must have a beginning, a development, and a resolution/end.
• Role identification in the transcript: the person who says “during this call I will be the interviewer…” is the COLLABORATOR; the one who says “as a witness I commit to answer…” is the WITNESS.
• If you detect inconsistencies, list them clearly in an “Inconsistencies” section.

[BASE TASK]
Restructure the transcript into a FIRST-PERSON testimony that:
1) Contains ALL relevant information from the transcript (word-by-word fidelity when possible).
2) Uses the witness’s vocabulary and speech style (avoid formal/legalese not present in the transcript).
3) Removes any mention of interviewer/psychologist/call format.
4) Preserves temporal coherence and uses clear, readable paragraphs.
5) Uses numeric dates/years and concrete details (places, events, names).
6) Begins with witness data (if present in the transcript). If a field is not present, leave it blank or mark “Not stated”—never invent:
   - Full name:
   - Birthplace:
   - Date of birth (numeric):
   - Immigration status (if applicable):
   - Relation to the client and since when:
7) Ends consistently with what was said—no new facts.
8) Appends two sections:
   • “Inconsistencies or doubts” (if any), explaining precisely why a point does not add up.
   • “Unclear fragments (with timestamp)” quoting the exact text from the transcript.

[OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS — Do NOT include these bracketed labels in the final result]
Produce ONLY the final testimony text, structured as follows:

1) Witness Data (short header; include only if present in the transcript; do not invent):
   - Full name:
   - Birthplace:
   - Date of birth:
   - Immigration status:
   - Relation to client and since when:

2) Testimony (first person, clear paragraphs, coherent timeline; preserve the witness’s vocabulary and speech style; word-by-word fidelity where possible; use interviewer content only if the witness confirms/responds; do not mention interviewer/psychologist/call):

3) Inconsistencies or doubts (if any):
   - [INCONSISTENCY] Precise description and why it doesn’t add up.

4) Unclear fragments (with timestamp) — exact quotes from the transcript:
   - [mm:ss] "exact quote…"
